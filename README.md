# Cards Against AI

## Description
This is a repository revolving around the application of LMs to the task of humour recognition, in the context of Cards Against Humanity games. The aim of this work is to analyse the relative improvements reinforcement learning, with human feedback, brings to humour recognition. Other aims also include analysing offensive humour, fill-in-the-blank style games and comparing performance against other techniques. All of this is subject to future change.

## Roadmap
- [X] Train GPT-2 models to experiment with text generation.
- [X] Look into other model types.
- [X] Split the readme files into their respective directories.
- [ ] Implement BERT version of model.
