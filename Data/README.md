Several data variants are present in the files, each of which are processed versions of the original data. All of the following variants ignore prompts which require more than one punchline. The data isn't actually on the repository as it's meant to be private.

### Cards Against Humanity data
This data is derived from the original Cards Against Humanity lab data, available upon request from mail@cardsagainsthumanity.com. This data was cleaned and split into a training split, validation split and testing split. We also generated another testing split with the uncleaned data for evaluation purposes.

### Humicroedit data
This data is sourced from earlier studies that attempted similar humour tasks, while we do not provide it on this repository, it is easily accessible online. We combined all of the data files in the dataset and generated our own training, validation and testing splits.
